<h2>Current Members</h2>

<h3>Garrett Hellenthal</h3>

Garrett is currently an Associate Professor at UCL, funded by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society. He received a PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington, and subsequently worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. He is currently developing and applying statistical methods to infer (i) the genetic structure of human populations (particularly in regions of Africa), (ii) historical periods when world-wide groups intermixed, for example due to invasions or migrations, and (iii) genetic loci facilitating humans' adaptations to new environments (including through methylation marks).

<h3>Louise Ormond</h3>

Louise earned a BA from Cambridge University in 2006 in Natural Sciences (Physics), and an MSc in the Immunology of Infectious Diseases from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in 2008 focused on malarial infection. She gained a PhD in Population Genetics in Jeff Jensen’s Lab at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2017, where her work covered population genetic inference using single time point data, and the modelling of infectious disease. Louise is currently a postdoc in Garrett's group at UGI working on methods for detecting selection in ancient and modern DNA.  Her interests lie in human evolutionary genetics and pathogen dynamics, and the interaction between the two.

<h3>Sam Morris</h3>

Sam is a third year PhD student on the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme (LIDo) and is supervised by Garrett. His PhD is based on developing new methods to infer patterns of haplotype-sharing between low coverage ancient DNA samples. He is also interested in applying them to novel ancient DNA datasets. Before working in the Hellenthal group, he studied infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). He is co-supervised by Dr. Laurent Frantz (Queen Mary University of London).

<h3>Nancy Bird</h3>

Nancy is a PhD student on the London NERC DTP investigating the genetic structure and signals of admixture and adaptation in worldwide human populations. She is currently focussing on groups from West/Central Africa.

<h3>Maria Derakhshan</h3>

Maria is a second-year PhD student on the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme (LIDo). She is co-supervised by Dr Matt Silver at the Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her PhD interests focus on using human methylation data from multiple populations to identify genetic regions that may enable rapid adaptation to environmental pressures. Prior to this, Maria completed a Bachelors degree in Natural Sciences (Durham University) and a Masters by Research in Molecular Plant and Microbial Sciences (Imperial College London).

<h3>Ziyang Zia</h3>

Ziyang is a MSc student in Genetics of Human Disease (Computational Genomics) at UCL and is supervised by Garrett. His current research focus is leveraging and improving new statistical methods to detect natural selection signals in East African populations in relation to demographic history. Prior to this, he obtained BSc Biological Sciences at Fudan University. He focused on genomic history of East Asia from ancient DNA perspective in his bachelor thesis (supervised by Dr. Shi Yan) and internship (supervised by Prof. Chuanchao Wang)
