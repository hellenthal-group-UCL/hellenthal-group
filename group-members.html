<h2>Current Members</h2>

<h3>Garrett Hellenthal</h3>

Garrett is currently an Associate Professor at UCL, funded by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society. He received a PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington, and subsequently worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. He is currently developing and applying statistical methods to infer (i) the genetic structure of human populations (particularly in regions of Africa), (ii) historical periods when world-wide groups intermixed, for example due to invasions or migrations, and (iii) genetic loci facilitating humans' adaptations to new environments (including through methylation marks).

<h3>Louise Ormond</h3>

Louise is a post-doc working on developing and applying methods to detect selection in modern and ancient individuals. 

<h3>Sam Morris</h3>

Sam is a BBSRC funded PhD student working on developing and applying new methods to analyse low coverage ancient DNA data. Second committ test. 

<h3>Nancy Bird</h3>

Nancy is a PhD student on the London NERC DTP investigating the genetic structure and signals of admixture and adaptation in worldwide human populations. She is currently focussing on groups from West/Central Africa.

<h3>Dan Jacobson</h3>

Dan is a first-year PhD student currently conducting rotations as part of the UCL-Birkbeck MRC Doctoral Training Partnership. He graduated in 2019 with an MSci in Natural Sciences from UCL, specifically majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology, and minoring in Mathematics and Statistics. He conducted his Masters project within the Hellenthal group, where he investigated the genetic basis of epigenetic variation in Gambian children.
