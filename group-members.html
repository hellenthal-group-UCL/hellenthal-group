<h2>Current Members</h2>

<h3>Garrett Hellenthal</h3>

Garrett is currently an Associate Professor at UCL, funded by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society. He received a PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington, and subsequently worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. He is currently developing and applying statistical methods to infer (i) the genetic structure of human populations (particularly in regions of Africa), (ii) historical periods when world-wide groups intermixed, for example due to invasions or migrations, and (iii) genetic loci facilitating humans' adaptations to new environments (including through methylation marks).

<h3>Leo Speidel</h3>

Leo is a Sir Henry Wellcome fellow at UCL, Genetics Institute and the Francis Crick Institute working on Statistical and Population Genetics. He is a member of Garrett's group (UCL) and Pontus Skoglund’s group (Crick). He is interested in developing powerful statistical tools that utilise the rapidly growing numbers of genomes of modern and ancient people to reconstruct our shared genetic past. Our genomes can, for instance, inform us about past migrations, introgression with Neanderthals and other extinct hominids, and adaptation to environmental or lifestyle changes throughout human history. In particular, he is interested in understanding how evolutionary forces have shaped our genetic differences and how these may impact our health.

<h3>Nancy Bird</h3>

Nancy is a PhD student on the London NERC DTP investigating the genetic structure and signals of admixture and adaptation in worldwide human populations. She is currently focussing on groups from West/Central Africa.

<h3>Maria Derakhshan</h3>

Maria is a second-year PhD student on the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme (LIDo). She is co-supervised by Dr Matt Silver at the Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her PhD interests focus on using human methylation data from multiple populations to identify genetic regions that may enable rapid adaptation to environmental pressures. Prior to this, Maria completed a Bachelors degree in Natural Sciences (Durham University) and a Masters by Research in Molecular Plant and Microbial Sciences (Imperial College London).

<h3>Ziyang Zia</h3>

Ziyang is a MSc student in Genetics of Human Disease (Computational Genomics) at UCL and is supervised by Garrett. His current research focus is leveraging and improving new statistical methods to detect natural selection signals in East African populations in relation to demographic history. Prior to this, he obtained BSc Biological Sciences at Fudan University. He focused on genomic history of East Asia from ancient DNA perspective in his bachelor thesis (supervised by Dr. Shi Yan) and internship (supervised by Prof. Chuanchao Wang)
