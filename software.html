<h1>
	Chromopainterv2
</h1>

<h5>
	Chromopainterv2 is a piece of software which can be used to infer patterns of haplotype sharing between individuals/populations. This information can be used to, amongst other things, infer population structure (fineSTRUCTURE), date admixture events (GLOBETROTTER) and estimate admixture proportions (SOURCEFIND). The source code, further instructions and worked examples can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sahwa/ChromoPainterv2", style="color:blue">here</a>. The original paper which describes the technical details can be found here <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002453", style="color:blue">here</a>
